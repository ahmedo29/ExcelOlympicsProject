# Olympics Dashboard

## Description
This project involves extracting, profiling, and analysing the Olympics data. The focus of this project was to create a dashboard which includes key information, such as the top 10 countries by medals, the number of medals won by gender, the number of medals won from each sport, etc. This projects aims to provide insightful visualisations for better undertsanding and interpretation of the data.

## Installation
Raw Data:
	athlete_events,
	country_definitions

Cleaned Data, Analysed Data, and the Dashboard:
	Olympics Dashboard

## Process
Data Importation: I downloaded all of the raw data from Kaggle, and then imported it all into Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning: I then formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, that there is no missing data, there is no duplicated data which is not needed, and corrected any errors and inconsistencies within the data. 

Data Analysis: I analysed the data to create useful insights, such as the top 10 countries by medals, the number of medals won by gender. I did this by using a range of data analysis skills, such as VLookups, Excel Functions, and Pivot Tables. 

Data Visualisations: I used the pivot tables to then create insightful visualiations to show a range of insights in the two dashboards that I created
